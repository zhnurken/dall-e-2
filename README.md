# dall-e-2

This is a Midjourney & DALL-E clone. 

In this project were used:
- React;
- React-router;
- Vite;
- Tailwindcss;
- MongoDB;
- Node.js;
- Express.js;
- OpenAI's DALL-E model: A deep learning model that generates images from text input;
- Cloudinary: A cloud-based image storage service;

This project was difficult to me, because there were  a new technologies for me like: 
- Vite;
- Tailwindcss;
- MongoDB;
- Node.js;
- Express.js; 

But it was interesting project.
